# Convergents

## Introduction

Introduction of programming best practices in c++ through the learning of different knowledges and skills :

* Oriented object programming and design patterns :
* Building Makefile.
* Automatic testing.

It will deserve a wider context in digital geometry.

## Oriented object programming and design patterns

[PointVector2D.h](https://github.com/homeostasie/convergents/blob/master/PointVector2D.h).

Class and templates initialization explain with the creation of functional tools in planar geometry.

1. Members
2. Inner types
3. Standard services
4. Read access
5. Comparisons
6. Operations
7. Norms

## Building Makefile

[Makefile](https://github.com/homeostasie/convergents/blob/master/Makefile).

Compile and execute the test files by launching this command in a terminal :

'''
make
make test
'''

## Automatic testing

[Automatic Tests](https://github.com/homeostasie/convergents/blob/master/testPointVector2D.cpp).

1. Basic operators
2. Arithmetic operators
3. Norms
